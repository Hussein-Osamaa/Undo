## 🆘 Troubleshooting SSH Issues

### Common SSH Problems

**Permission denied (publickey):**
```bash
# Check if SSH agent is running
ssh-add -l

# Add your SSH key
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Test connection
ssh -T git@github.com
```

**Host key verification failed:**
```bash
# Remove old host key
ssh-keygen -R github.com

# Add new host key
ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```

**SSH key not found:**
```bash
# List SSH keys
ls -la ~/.ssh/

# Generate new key if needed
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

### Alternative: Use HTTPS
If SSH continues to have issues, you can use HTTPS instead:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Hussein-Osamaa/Undo.git
```
